    <h2>CSS이란 무엇인가?</h2>

<p>Håkon Wium Lie, chief technical officer of the Opera Software company and co-creator of the CSS web standard
CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994.[19] At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN.[20] Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1)[21] being released in 1996. In particular, Bert Bos' proposal was influential; he became co-author of CSS1 and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.[22]</p>

<p>Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML) in the 1980s, and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web.[23] One requirement for a web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore, existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS, on the other hand, let a document's style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of "cascading" styles.</p>
